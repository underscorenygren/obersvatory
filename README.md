## Observatory

This project aims to make it easier to inspect events in redshift.

It provides a way to inspect redshift data in python, and build graphs interactively from it.

It's a simpler version of tools like Elasticsearch, Mode, etc.

It also provides a way to generate documentation for events to markdown
